        <h2>The Precious Little Beginning</h2>
        <p class="message">
            With New Year around the clock, us sharing pfps like silly little kids who never knew how precious this little relationship was ever gonna be—a little stupid, we started off being bold and young, freaky asf with energy beyond measure. 
            Laughing like there was no tomorrow, sleeping together in a call... Pfft, seeing you so happy and safe with me, I wanted to keep you with me... always. 
            I still remember when you showed me those fireworks. So pretty, so divine. I knew this was going to be a start to something very, very special. Very, very precious.

        <h1 class="dreamspace-heading">Adventures in the Realm of Dreams</h1>
        <p class="message">
            Together, we dreamed about a future full of happiness: being together, raising little kids who would make us laugh, and having cute cats and dogs to share our home with. Just imagine us traveling the world, discovering new places, and making great memories. Living in our cozy house, every day would be an adventure with late-night talks and fun times. Pfft, it would be so awesome to create our own little paradise, filled with joy and excitement, where every moment feels like a fresh start. Just being with you in that space was a dream I always wanted to live in.

        <h1>My Little Bunny</h1>
        <p>
            The little bunny I know—sweet and short, usually so shy, yet mischievous at times. Her heart ached a little more with every fight, every minute we spent apart, until she’d had enough. I never knew how much she wanted to get away from me, or maybe she wanted to escape her own feelings—I’ll never truly know. The rock I once was for her slowly crumbled as time slipped away, taken up by more responsibilities and less time together. Slowly, she met new people, ones who had more time and patience than I could offer. And gradually, that love we once shared started to slip away, replaced by something she couldn’t hold onto. The fire we once burned so brightly in slowly changed into a quiet pile of ash.

        <h1>The Little Boy She Once Loved</h1>
        <p>
            The little boy—the rock who had once solidified himself to support the little girl—always carried the weight of inadequacy. The harder he fought, the more he felt it. Slowly and surely, that rock began to shatter. He realized he couldn’t help that little girl anymore, and reality set in. The more he fought against it, the more he changed... until he became unrecognizable, even to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            When he heard the news of his own deteriorating health, he broke down, retreating into himself, tears flowing. He knew he wasn’t the one for her anymore. He knew he couldn’t be what he wanted to be for her—not anymore. 'It’s over, isn’t it?' repeated in his mind as he watched her move forward, finding happiness with others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, he couldn’t help but be happy for her too. The little girl he once knew had fought so hard, rising up stronger than ever. She was so beautiful, and he couldn’t be prouder of the strong person she had become.

        <p>
            Just for now... I’m gonna call you my little bunny. Mhm... pfft—you make me proud, okay? You are the strongest person I know and the most beautiful. You didn’t ask to be, but you were always half of me, the single most precious person I ever had. You were so close to my heart in this cold, cold world; your smile made everything warm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pfft, I promised so many things to you, and I owe you so much. Thank you for staying for so long; you are the reason I’ve made it this far. I can’t help but wish you were still here.I still have a hard time listening to wock and aki talk about u on how u guys spend so much time pfft and hav so much fun tbh..im happy that ur happy.I’m sorry for changing so much. I’m sorry for becoming this person. I’m sorry for not being able to make enough time for you. I’m sorry for not being there when you needed me the most. I’m sorry...
        </p>
        <p>
            If I don’t make it, please know I always loved you with everything I had. I may have been inadequate, but I always loved you with all my heart, my little bunny. Please, always be happy. I love you.

        <p>
            I know you opened this website wanting to hear about this, pfft. I'm sorry for taking you on such an emotional ride. 
            I know you're trying your best to distance yourself from me with all the unfollows and everything. Mhm, I'll get to the point: 
            I sadly have a malignant tumor, so umm... yeah, there's your answer. I’m going to be bald for some time too. 😭😭
        </p>
        <p>
            Doctors said it’s treatable, but they didn’t guarantee that I wouldn’t end up disabled. Pfft, I know I'll always regret this 
            for the rest of my life, but I’m happy you got to get away. 🫂🫂 Always be happy, mhm? My little bunny, I’m sorry if you hate me now, but my last request to you is that 
            I hope you can process these feelings later on in your life so that if I do survive and, against all odds, come to see you, 
            I’d love to meet you at least once in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please know that I am with you the only way I can be. Keep that ring safe, mhm.
