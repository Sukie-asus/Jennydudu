        <h2>The Precious Little Beginning</h2>
        <p class="message">
            With New Year around the clock, us sharing pfps like silly little kids who never knew how precious this little relationship was ever gonna be‚Äîa little stupid, we started off being bold and young, freaky asf with energy beyond measure. 
            Laughing like there was no tomorrow, sleeping together in a call... Pfft, seeing you so happy and safe with me, I wanted to keep you with me... always. 
            I still remember when you showed me those fireworks. So pretty, so divine. I knew this was going to be a start to something very, very special. Very, very precious.

        <h1 class="dreamspace-heading">Adventures in the Realm of Dreams</h1>
        <p class="message">
            Together, we dreamed about a future full of happiness: being together, raising little kids who would make us laugh, and having cute cats and dogs to share our home with. Just imagine us traveling the world, discovering new places, and making great memories. Living in our cozy house, every day would be an adventure with late-night talks and fun times. Pfft, it would be so awesome to create our own little paradise, filled with joy and excitement, where every moment feels like a fresh start. Just being with you in that space was a dream I always wanted to live in.

        <h1>My Little Bunny</h1>
        <p>
            The little bunny I know‚Äîsweet and short, usually so shy, yet mischievous at times. Her heart ached a little more with every fight, every minute we spent apart, until she‚Äôd had enough. I never knew how much she wanted to get away from me, or maybe she wanted to escape her own feelings‚ÄîI‚Äôll never truly know. The rock I once was for her slowly crumbled as time slipped away, taken up by more responsibilities and less time together. Slowly, she met new people, ones who had more time and patience than I could offer. And gradually, that love we once shared started to slip away, replaced by something she couldn‚Äôt hold onto. The fire we once burned so brightly in slowly changed into a quiet pile of ash.

        <h1>The Little Boy She Once Loved</h1>
        <p>
            The little boy‚Äîthe rock who had once solidified himself to support the little girl‚Äîalways carried the weight of inadequacy. The harder he fought, the more he felt it. Slowly and surely, that rock began to shatter. He realized he couldn‚Äôt help that little girl anymore, and reality set in. The more he fought against it, the more he changed... until he became unrecognizable, even to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            When he heard the news of his own deteriorating health, he broke down, retreating into himself, heavy hearted, crashing out, od'ing himself with meds to make him feel something. He knew he wasn‚Äôt the one for her anymore. He knew he couldn‚Äôt be what he wanted to be for her‚Äînot anymore. 'It‚Äôs over, isn‚Äôt it?' repeated in his mind as he watched her move forward, finding happiness with others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, he couldn‚Äôt help but be happy for her too. The little girl he once knew had fought so hard, rising up stronger than ever. She was so beautiful, and he couldn‚Äôt be prouder of the strong person she had become.

        <h1>I'm Sorry</h1>
        <p>
            Just for now... I‚Äôm gonna call you my little bunny. Mhm... pfft‚Äîyou make me proud, okay? You are the strongest person I know and the most beautiful. You didn‚Äôt ask to be, but you were always half of me, the single most precious person I ever had. You were so close to my heart in this cold, cold world; your smile made everything warm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pfft, I promised so many things to you, and I owe you so much. Thank you for staying for so long; you are the reason I‚Äôve made it this far. I can‚Äôt help but wish you were still here.I still have a hard time listening to wock and aki talk about u on how u guys spend so much time pfft and hav so much fun tbh..im happy that ur happy.I‚Äôm sorry for changing so much. I‚Äôm sorry for becoming this person. I‚Äôm sorry for not being able to make enough time for you. I‚Äôm sorry for not being there when you needed me the most. I‚Äôm sorry...
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm so sorry for how things have been between us. I can understand why you feel like I‚Äôve wasted years of your life and to be honest I‚Äôd agree with you. I did waste your years and time with me. I was selfish and immature and didn‚Äôt think anything was wrong with how things were when we were together. I let you do it all to satisfy me until you couldn‚Äôt do that anymore because it was just too much for me to put on you, it‚Äôs a give and take it‚Äôs both of us giving 100% not just you. I didn‚Äôt treat you as well as you did me, I‚Äôm sorry. I hated that we argued so much, cried so much, and struggled so much. A lot of it was me, I was a bad boyfriend, friend, and lover. I had a warped view of love and of myself and I self-sabotaged our time together. You deserved my best, not my worst. I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt do anything to even attempt to change and be better for you sooner. I know even now we still have our issues and I‚Äôm sorry for that, you have no idea how much I wanted things to be good for us. You‚Äôre such a great woman. I understand if I‚Äôm remembered in your mind as a guy who ruined your life for 3 years. I‚Äôll accept it, I didn‚Äôt treat you like I should have, believe it or not I do know how I should have treated you and what you deserved, I was just too caught up in myself and being happy myself that I didn‚Äôt let you be happy. I‚Äôm sorry for that. Please forgive me. I‚Äôll never forgive myself for what I did to you.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            please know that if u like wock i wish you both the best okay? make sure to hav as much fun u guys can hav possible if not find someone handsome okay u better do dont u dare feel miserable and settle for someone not enough like u did for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I don‚Äôt make it, please know I always loved you with everything I had. I may have been inadequate, but I always loved you with all my heart, my little bunny. Please, always be happy. I love you.

        <p>
            I know you opened this website wanting to hear about this, pfft. I'm sorry for taking you on such an emotional ride. 
            I know you're trying your best to distance yourself from me with all the unfollows and everything. Mhm, I'll get to the point: 
            I sadly have a malignant tumor, so umm... yeah, just a bit of cancer, there's your answer. I‚Äôm going to be bald for some time too buahahaha,
        </p>
        <p>
            Doctors said it‚Äôs treatable, but they didn‚Äôt guarantee that I wouldn‚Äôt end up disabled. Pfft, I know I'll always regret this 
            for the rest of my life, but I‚Äôm happy you got to get away, sorry for making that decision for you. ü´Çü´Ç Always be happy, mhm? My little bunny, I‚Äôm sorry if you hate me now, but my last request to you is that 
            I hope you can process these feelings later on in your life so that if I do survive and, against all odds, 
            I‚Äôd love to meet you at least once in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please know that I am with you the only way I can be. Keep that ring safe, mhm.
